\bigskip Dear <RECIPIENT-PREFIX> <RECIPIENT>,

\medskip I am excited to apply for the <FULL-POSITION> position at <COMPANY>. With a robust background encompassing aerospace engineering and ongoing studies in a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I offer a unique blend of skills poised to drive networking innovation within <COMPANY>. With <COMPANY> being a leader in the field, I'm excited for the opportunity to join such a prolific and successful team.

\medskip In my current role as a Real-Time Embedded Software Engineer at Boeing Phantom Works, I've showcased my ability to optimize high-performance computing systems. From scaling data storage infrastructure using RoCE technology paired with Rook Ceph, to developing a Grafana monitoring dashboard with a Prometheus datasource backend for streamlined deployment. If hired at <COMPANY>, I can apply my coding specialties and technical skills and help the team achieve similar success.

\medskip My passion for networking is underscored by my initiative in setting up a personal home lab server environment. This project reflects my dedication to practical hands-on learning and showcases my ability to work with various networking technologies, enhancing my comprehension of routing, protocols, and security mechanisms. Check out my work \href{https://github.com/dancard32/homelab}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}. Through this project, I aim to stay ahead of emerging trends in the software engineering field, where I have taken the initiative to self-teach myself various technologies highly relevant to modern software development, including Ansible, Helm, Docker, and Kubernetes. Through intensive self-study and hands-on experimentation, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of these technologies, their applications, and their integration within software development workflows.

\medskip I am excited about the possibility of applying my networking acumen and hands-on initiative to <COMPANY>. I look forward to discussing how my qualifications align with your team's goals. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at \href{mailto:dcard@umich.edu}{dcard@umich.edu} or by phone at (810) 728-6754, if you would like to view my portfolio and my programming/engineering projects feel free to check them out \href{https://dancard32.github.io/website/#/projects}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}. Thank you for considering my application.
