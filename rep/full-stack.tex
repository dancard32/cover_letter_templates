\bigskip Dear <RECIPIENT-PREFIX> <RECIPIENT>,

\medskip I am thrilled to express my sincere interest in the <FULL-POSITION> position at <COMPANY>. With a robust background encompassing aerospace engineering and ongoing studies in a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I offer a unique blend of skills poised to drive innovation within your technology stack. Furthermore, I have a demonstrated history of success that I am confident will positively impact your software engineering team.

\medskip In my current role as a Real-Time Embedded Software Engineer at Boeing Phantom Works, I've showcased my ability to optimize high-performance computing systems. From scaling data storage infrastructure using RoCE technology paired with Rook Ceph, to developing a Grafana monitoring dashboard with a Prometheus datasource backend for streamlined deployment. Furthermore, my Front-End Software Engineer experience at Northrop Grumman, where I optimized a map viewer, highlighted my proficiency in web development, I've consistently delivered exceptional results across all areas of the stack.

\medskip While outside of academia and my professional work, I aim to stay ahead of emerging trends in the software engineering field, I have taken the initiative to self-teach myself various technologies highly relevant to modern software development, including Ansible, Helm, Docker, and Kubernetes. Through intensive self-study and hands-on experimentation, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of these technologies, their applications, and their integration within software development workflows. I am proud to say that I have successfully applied these technologies in my project, where I set up and managed a homelab server environment. Check out my work \href{https://github.com/dancard32/homelab}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}.

\medskip My passion for technology, commitment to learning, and track record of successful projects make me an enthusiastic and capable contributor to your Full-Stack team. I look forward to discussing further how my qualifications align with your team's goals. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me at \href{mailto:dcard@umich.edu}{dcard@umich.edu} or by phone at (810) 728-6754, if you would like to view my portfolio and my programming/engineering projects feel free to check them out \href{https://dancard32.github.io/website/#/projects}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}. Thank you for considering my application.
