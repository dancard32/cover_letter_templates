\bigskip Dear <RECIPIENT-PREFIX> <RECIPIENT>,

\medskip I am excited to apply for the <FULL-POSITION> role at <COMPANY>. With a robust background encompassing aerospace engineering and ongoing studies in a Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, I offer a unique blend of skills that equips me with a blend of analytical prowess and problem-solving acumen vital for driving system reliability.

\medskip In my current role as a Real-Time Embedded Software Engineer at Boeing Phantom Works, I've consistently harnessed innovative solutions to optimize systems and drive reliability. By combining RoCE technology, Rook, and Ceph, I've achieved extraordinary results - notably a 400\% latency reduction and a 10x increase in storage IOPS to ensure full-bandwidth data logging. My proficiency extends to creating Grafana monitoring dashboards with Prometheus backends, streamlining integration and deployment through effective data visualization to further increase system and site reliability. If hired at <COMPANY>, I can apply my coding specialties and technical skills and help the team achieve similar success.

\medskip While outside of academia and my professional work, I aim to stay ahead of emerging trends in the software engineering field, I have taken the initiative to self-teach myself various technologies highly relevant to modern software development, including Ansible, Helm, Docker, and Kubernetes. Through intensive self-study and hands-on experimentation, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of these technologies, their applications, resulting in a robust and reliability system. I am proud to say that I have successfully applied these technologies in my project, where I set up and managed a homelab server environment. Check out my work \href{https://github.com/dancard32/homelab}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}.

\medskip I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to apply my skills and passion for reliability engineering at <COMPANY>. For further discussion on how my qualifications align with your objectives, please feel free to reach out to me at \href{mailto:dcard@umich.edu}{dcard@umich.edu} or by phone at (810) 728-6754, if you would like to view my portfolio and my programming/engineering projects feel free to check them out \href{https://dancard32.github.io/website/#/projects}{\textbf{\underline{here}}}. Thank you for considering my application.
